			'I am personally delighted to have Aastha, Ankit, Inderjot, Parvartika, Ritika and Sahil Third Year students from Amity University, Computer Science Department working as Interns for our Ericsson Global Internal Sub Unit Project. Albeit in the nascent stage of learning Computer Science nuances the manner the students have tried to Plan, structure, Innovate and implement Our project on Service delivery tracker tool after whetting the present day technologies and research into tools available shows up their synch with the new technologies in vogue and zeal for imbibing newer technologies The way these the students have taken challenge to work on the project independently speaks volumes of their positive attitude. Commitment, enthusiasm, resourcefulness and collaborative approach they a have displayed while working on this Project is indicative of the supportive environment of the Institution they are budding from and I am sanguine if they work like this they would make into excellent Computer Science engineers. I wish them all the best.',
