			'Dear Amitians, I, Saurabh Garg (M.Tech - Computer Science & Engineering Batch 2016-2018) is a proud alumni of this esteemed institution now working as a Team Lead in a reputed IT organization. My experience as a student with Amity makes me express my gratitude to the faculty, curriculum, and placement cell for their invaluable contributions in the overall development . I wanted to name and thank everyone here but special gratitude to Dr. Abhay Bansal Sir and Dr. Shailendra Narayan SinghSir for their constant support towards their students and designing an industry standard M.Tech programme. An advice to Juniors If you join B.Tech or M.Tech in Amity, start research from Day 1. Ask questions and get your concepts cleared from the faculty. Amity has an environment to encourage students outside their curriculum also. Focus more on the learning part than following the race of grades so that tomorrow you become a motivation for someone else by making your college proud of you :)',

			"The years I spend in Amity University while pursuing my B-Tech (CSE) and M-Tech (CSE) were the best years of my life. These years spent at Amity helped me to Broaden my Horizon in every aspect of life which eventually shaped my personality and infused self-confidence which made me corporate ready. Amity is not an institution but an experience which will stay with you throughout your life. These were the best fun years as well especially doing Research and Development in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning while Publishing many Research Papers in International Journal & Conferences under the guidance of my esteemed Professors and learning at Amity Technical Placement Centre (ATPC). While I was at campus, I was guided and mentored by the best, not just faculties but also the best of people. I found a very efficient and effective support system in my teachers and friends. They inspired and encouraged me to excel in every aspect of my life. I was always encouraged to choose my work-life balance independently. This independence was a major contributor to the various awards and recognitions that were bestowed upon me later in my life like Academic Performance Award, Best in Technical Innovation Award, Significant contribution in Research Award, and many more. Truth to be told that when I received my Final Result tears trickled down my cheeks and it was a bitter sweet moment for me realizing all the memories I have gathered throughout my journey at Amity University and now it was time to leave it. But I don't think I could ever leave it behind as now it has become a part of me and it will remain with me throughout my life. I got my first break from the campus itself. I realize now that it was not just studies, but the overall development which took place at Amity and that helped me to climb the corporate ladder making me ready to face the professional world because now I was already well versed and Accustomed with the challenges of life. I thank the institution and the founders from the bottom of my heart.",

			"Hi Fellas, As an honoured alumnus of Amity University, Noida, I come here again to feel the campus life vibrance through my message. Therefore, I want to share with the new students a glimpse into what your journey will bring in. Well, here it's more than Just Academics; depends on you rather if you can make it an experience that shapes you for life, for the better. I belonged to the Computer Science and Engineering department, ASET and for me the classrooms and my interactions with my professors became a launchpad for my knowledge and the beginning of the exposure that I needed. Aligning with my research interests, there were dedicated faculty members who catalysed the research bent of my mind and helped in shaping my future career in this. I firmly believe learning extends beyond textbooks and surely Amity proved to be citadel for this, and ignited my destiny to be forged into purpose. Amity facilitated me to extend my embers of learning from the exposures where I could present my research in various conferences, had an active participation in the guest lectures and fruitful interactions with learned researchers. Amity throws a world of opportunities such as academic competitions, research activities, conferences for the hard-core researchers, sports events for the enthusiasts, cultural events with all the buzz days. Also, the food festivals are a treat to the foodies accompanied with grand eventful celebrity nights. Amity has range of top-class food outlets where I enjoyed myself thoroughly with every dish tasted at the end of my first year. Fortunately, the college also has great gym facilities to shed the extras coming from the amazing food and mess services. I will not forget to acknowledge my friends with whom I have made a life kaleidoscope experiencing support and happiness. It really helps steer through the difficult times in your college life, push your boundaries and moreover, lessons you with real-world life situations. So, here's my submission to all the future Amitians; I advise: embrace the journey and nurture it with good experiences. Bad food to stomach and mind both is harmful. I am sure you will discover and sculpt the best version of your own heroical narratives. Best wishes, Your fellow alumnus Oshin Rawlley Chanakya PhD Fellow, IIT Indore  Working in Disruptive Technologies Lab, Dept of CSIS Birla Institute of Technology, Pilani, Pilani Campus, (Raj.), India Profile Webpage   ",
